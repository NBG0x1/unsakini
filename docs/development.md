**Unsakini** is built on top of Rails 5 and Angular 2. The backend is a [Rails API-only](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api) application.
Documentation of the controllers, models, and classes can be viewed using yard. Simply run `yardoc` if you have the `yard` gem installed. The doc is outputed to `./public/docs/backend/`. Run the local server to view the docs:
```
$ bundle exec rails server
```
