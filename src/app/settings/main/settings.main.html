  As of October 28 2016, new cryptography algorythm has been implemented, base on
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23188593/cryptojs-check-if-aes-passphrase-is-correct">this discussion on SO</a>. In the new cryptography algorythm, we prepended the data with HmacSHA256 encryption. This is to be able to tell if the passphrase used in decryption is the same as the one used during encryption. If you get <code>Cryptographic Problem Encountered</code> errors, this is because of the new algorythm. To get your old data, go to deployed <a href="https://unsakini-old-algo.herokuapp.com">old source of www.unsakini.com</a>. Until then, you can't access your dashboard until we delete your data.
  <a href="mailto:pitogo.adones@gmail.com">Email me</a> so I can delete your old data and you can access your dashboard. Just add your <a href="https://unsakini-old-algo.herokuapp.com">old data</a> back.

  Deleting your private key from this browser will make sure no one can obtain your key while you're away. We will ask for it once you log in back.
