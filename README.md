UNSAKINI
-----------

**[Unsakini](https://www.unsakini.com)** is an open source encrypted bulletin board created to protect online activists from digital information surveillance. Made on top of [Rails 5](http://rubyonrails.org/) and [Angular 2](https://angular.io/).

-----------------------

If you look at the network traffic in the browser network tab, you'll see that sensitive data sent to the server are gibberesh. This is because they are encrypted using your private key before it leaves your computer. The key is stored in your browser and is never sent to the server. Only you have access to your private key.

To increase the security, the data is also encrypted in the server before being saved to the database, which adds a second layer of encrypion.

The data is ecnrypted using [Advanced Encryption System (AES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard), the most widely used and trusted encryption algorithm.

### Planned Features
- [x] Encrypt data
- [ ] Upload and encrypt files
- [ ] Share encrypted data and files to other users

-------------------------

### System Requirements
 - Node.js < 7.0.0
 - Ruby >= 2.2.2
 - Mysql

### Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/adonespitogo/unsakini.git my-project
$ cd my-project
$ bundle install
$ cd angular
$ npm install -g angular-cli gulp
$ npm install
```

### Configuration
 - Rails configurations can be found `./config` directory. Feel free to modify as needed, specially the database configuration.
 - Angular configurations are located at `./angular/src/environments`.

### Running Local Server
Navigate to project root directory
```
$ cd my-project
```
Run setup database
```
$ rake db:setup
```
Run local Rails server
```
$ rails s
```
Browse [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Documentation
 - The backend is a traditional [Rails 5](http://rubyonrails.org/) app. See the [YARD documentation](https://www.unsakini.com/docs/backend/).
 - The frontend is made of [Angular 2](https://angular.io/). See the [documentation](https://www.unsakini.com/docs/frontend/).

### Testing
 - Using [Rspec](http://rspec.info/) in testing Rails backend
 - See [Angular 2 Testing Guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/testing.html)

Run rails tests
```
$ rspec
```
Run angular tests
```
Not yet implemented!
```
